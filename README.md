### -Challenges : 
Data Transformation:
Depending on the analysis I wish to conduct, I have transformed variables and created new features.

Choosing 3.35 as the overall score of the restaurant to clarify where the weakness points are

### -ideas :
1 -  group features related to similar topics like :
Technological Factors(
WiFi Service
Entertainment Options
Online Support
Ease of Online Booking
Online Menu Access)

2 - Grouping Areas nearest from each other in one group to perform analysis on each group

3 - Grouping wait time for tables to detect the best time segment performance. For example:

0 - Current Table
1 - 15 Minutes Waiting
16 - 30 Minutes Waiting
30 - 60 Minutes Waiting
More Than 60 Minutes Waiting"
